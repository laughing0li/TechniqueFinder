# AuScope Geochemistry Network LabFinder

AGN LabFinder is used to identify and understand the analysis techniques available to researchers through the Australian Geochemistry Network.

## Implementation Details

LabFinder is a based on Microscopy Australia's [Technique Finder](https://github.com/IntersectAustralia/TechniqueFinder) web application.

This uses a PHP [Code Igniter](https://codeigniter.com/) platform.

We have adapted it to run on Google Cloud Platform's [App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/)

We use [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) to provide login access to the admin pages.
